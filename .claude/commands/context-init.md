Read the following context files in order and summarize the current project state:

1. First, read `.claude/INDEX.md` for navigation
2. Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for development standards
3. Read `PLANNING.md` for architecture overview
4. Read `TASK.md` for current tasks

After reading, provide a brief summary of:
- Project type and tech stack
- Current sprint tasks
- Key architectural patterns
- Any blockers or issues noted

This establishes context for the development session.
