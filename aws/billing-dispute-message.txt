SUBJECT: Request for Courtesy Credit - Unexpected CloudWatch Logs Charges (~$3,500)

---

Hello AWS Billing Team,

I am writing to request a courtesy credit for unexpected Amazon CloudWatch Logs charges on my account (498251986918).

SITUATION:
I deployed two ECS Fargate services (ebl-backend-service and ebl-frontend-service) and was unaware that Fargate automatically configures the "awslogs" log driver by default. I did not intentionally enable CloudWatch logging and had no idea that all container stdout was being shipped to CloudWatch Logs.

Over time, this resulted in approximately 2TB of logs being stored in CloudWatch, generating significant and unexpected charges (~$3,500).

ACTIONS TAKEN TO RESOLVE:
I have now:
1. Created new task definitions WITHOUT CloudWatch logging:
   - ebl-backend:7 (no logConfiguration)
   - ebl-frontend:6 (no logConfiguration)
2. Updated both ECS services to use these new task definitions
3. Deleted both CloudWatch log groups:
   - /ecs/ebl-backend (1.95 TB)
   - /ecs/ebl-frontend (86 MB)

This issue will not recur.

REQUEST:
As a small developer/business, this unexpected $3,500 charge for logs I never knowingly configured is a significant hardship. I respectfully request a one-time courtesy credit or adjustment for these CloudWatch Logs charges.

I understand AWS provides powerful services, and I take responsibility for monitoring my usage going forward. However, the default behavior of Fargate automatically enabling CloudWatch logging without explicit opt-in or clear warnings during setup contributed to this situation.

I would greatly appreciate any consideration you can provide.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
